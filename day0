I arrived via train in the historic city of Portland (the First Portland, as they say around here) in the mid afternoon. It was raining and blustery out and made for a grey but very beautifully dramatic landscape as is the norm for New England. I hopped in the first Uber I could grab and made my way to my hotel. After checking-in, fielding some worked getting settled, I meander my way through the Old Port area to the Casco Bay Lines for the event of the evening; The Monktoberfest Harbor Cruise mixer. It was pretty easy to find the right boat by the collection of techie looking folks standing around with various technology related shirts. This being my second Monktoberfest, I knew what to expect and immediately remembered how casual and approachable everyone is that was in attendance. While waiting for the boat I immediately struck up conversation with the nearest person next to me. A native of Portland I made fast friends with Sarah Hines (@sarah_hines) who owns a local WordPress shop, [Shines & Jecker](http://shinesandjecker.com) , and services a variety of small and medium sized businesses. While standing in line I also saw the infamous Samantha Ready (@samantha_ready), from SFDC, and looped her into my growing circle of pre-cruise friends. We also me John Stoltenborg (@tlots), another Portland area developer and I learned that everyone in my little circle was a first-time-monktoberfester. On board the boat we got into the bar line before it got too big so as to sample some of the delicious local Maine brews. I grabbed a Bissel Brewery's “The Substance” and headed outside to get some fresh air on the cruise and meet some more folks. I met Peter Busque (@busquep1), an engineer at Cisco's Meta Cloud and owner of the Hopyard, as well as re-met my buddy (from when I used to develop for Newsgator), Ashley Roach (@aroach) who now also works at Cisco as an API architect. Overall, there was an incredible mix of folks with a variety of technical backgrounds and lots of interesting things to say. This event was off to a great start from the get-go.
