## Monktoberfest 2015: Day 0

#### Location: Portland, ME
#### Date: 20150930

I arrived via train in the historic city of Portland (the First Portland, as they say around here) in the mid afternoon. It was raining and blustery out and made for a grey but very beautifully dramatic landscape as is the norm for New England. I hopped in the first Uber I could grab and made my way to my hotel. After checking-in, fielding some worked getting settled, I meander my way through the Old Port area to the Casco Bay Lines for the event of the evening; The Monktoberfest Harbor Cruise mixer. 

In case you've not heard of [Monktoberfest](http://monktoberfest.com/) "un" conference, it's a small, informal collection of technologist and beer lovers that convene in the great city of Portland, Maine. For the 2 days of the event, the attendees listen to talks on a variety of technology-centric topics ranging from diveristy to continuous deliver to homebrew automation. Oh, and also partaking in some amazing beers. I have to think that Portland is the capital of craft beers. 

It was pretty easy to find the right boat by the collection of "techie" looking folks standing around enrobred with various technology related shirts, hats, and satchels. This being my second Monktoberfest, I knew what to expect and immediately remembered how casual and approachable everyone is that attends. While waiting for the boat I immediately struck up conversation with the nearest person next to me. A native of Portland I made fast friends with Sarah Hines ([@sarah_hines](https://twitter.com/sarah_hines)) who owns a local WordPress shop, [Shines & Jecker](http://shinesandjecker.com) , and services a variety of small and medium sized businesses. While standing in line I also saw the infamous Samantha Ready ([@samantha_ready](https://twitter.com/samantha_ready)), from SFDC, and looped her into my growing circle of pre-cruise friends. We also met John Stoltenborg ([@tlots](https://twitter.com/tlots)), another Portland area developer and I learned that everyone in my initial circle was a first-time-monktoberfester. 

On board the boat we got into the bar line before it got too big so as to sample some of the delicious local Maine brews. I grabbed a Bissel Brewery's “The Substance” and headed outside to get some fresh air on the cruise and meet some more folks. I met Peter Busque ([@busquep1](https://twitter.com/busquep1)), an engineer at Cisco's Meta Cloud and owner of the Hopyard, as well as re-met my buddy (from when I used to develop for Newsgator), Ashley Roach ([@aroach](https://twitter.com/aroach)) who now also works at Cisco as an API architect. Overall, there was an incredible mix of folks with a variety of technical backgrounds and lots of interesting things to say. This event was off to a terrific start.

After the cruise various groups peeled off in search of some food and more conversations. Over dinner I talked with Fintan Ryan ([@fintanr](https://twitter.com/fintanr)) who's an analyst from Redmonk's London office. We discussed a myriad of topics ranging from Heroku's new VPC offering
 to what city's jay walking is the accepted norm. I also hung out with the amazing Dave Carroll ([@dcarroll](https://twitter.com/dcarroll)), SFDC dev evangalist, with whom I had a fun philological discussion as well as talked Salesforce shop.
